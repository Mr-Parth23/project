       <p> I love your voice and smile it's so cute ❤️, I still remember your voice clearly from Aug23 when we met up.
        It was really pleasent hear you talk, but was a shame that I couldn't hear it for very long. I like your smile the most, its kind, gentle,addictive and graceful I'm so in love with that. You are very dazzling, I'm infatuated. </p>
